# SoFi Bank: Module 1 Challenge
## Overview and Origin
![SoFiLogo](SoFi.png)


SoFi (Social Finance) Technologies, Inc. was founded in 2011 by Mike Cagney, Dan Macklin, James Finnigan, and Ian Brady. The founders saw the potential in using technology to both connect with customers and lower their overhead expenses.

> ### **"Traditional banks weren't fully harnessing the power of the web to connect with their customers so they (SoFi) built a whole business around the idea."** 
> #### *Jim Cramer, Mad Money*

SoFi began at Standford University as a "peer-to-peer lending network," allowing alumni to "make low interest loans to current students." Now, valued at $8 billion, SoFi has expanded to offer a variety of financial services that include borrowing, investing, spending, and insuring assets (*Finty*).

## Business Activities

SoFi offers finanical independence to a younger demographic that is still in the early stages of growing their wealth. Through their high yield savings accounts and various products, such as SoFi Money and SoFi Investing, they offer resources that many millennials and generation zer's would otherwise be priced out of receiving.

Compared to traditional banks, SoFi can offer higher interest rates (currently a market-leading 4.60% APY) and no account fees. By not having any physical branches and using some new technologies (Python, Google Analytics, and Visual Studio Code, to name a few) they are able to give back to their customers some of what they save on overhead costs.

## Landscape

In about 30 years, online banking has gone from a new technology used by very few to a service that FinTech Magazine reports 80% of global banking customers regularly use. One major innovation has been mobile apps, which offer customers the ability to check their balances, deposit checks, and transfer funds from anywhere that receives cellphone service or WiFi signal.

Sofi is not the only all-online bank option, though. Companies such as CIBC, Discover Bank, and Ally Bank are other popular options.

## Results
An important metric for determining the strength and success of a company is its growth, both in members and products. For the third quarter of 2023, SoFi reported a record high 717,000 new members. Since 2022's third quarter end, SoFi has seen a 47% membership increase and 45% product increase.

While SoFi's future looks very bright, there other, bigger digital banks in the market. NuBank, which is not available in the United States, closed their third quarter of 2023 with 89.1 million members.

NuBank, which has become ubiquitous in Latin America,  is no longer growing at the rate of SoFi. Expect SoFi to follow a similar pattern: continued high growth, eventually plateauing from saturating the market.

## Recommendations

Something glaringly missing from SoFi (and competitors' websites) was the mention of racial bias in artificial intelligence. It's a problem seen in traditional banking institutions, too. The problem persists because AI systems that collect and analyze data use historical datasets, which are often incomplete due to systemic racism.

"Algorithmic discrimination" is unfortunately common, stemming from programmers' own racial biases. SoFi should acknowledge this problem, which will persist without intervention. The systems they use to increase their profit margin are the same systems making it unjustly difficult for others to secure a loan, making it harder to pursue higher education, purchase a home, start a small business, and other milestones.

> ### **“You are developing algorithms to determine the riskiness of different districts and individuals. And while you may not include the data point of someone’s race, it is implicitly picked up.”** 
> #### *Rumman Chowdhury, Data Scientist*

Using the same business model behind SoFi's competitive APY (annual percentage yield), SoFi should invest in ways to combat AI's racial bias; a technological problem it did not create but does perpetuate.

The majority of employees working in online banking are white men. Offering scholarships to learn programming could both incentivize and make it financially possible for people from different backgrounds to join the field, bringing with them an underrepresented perspective.
